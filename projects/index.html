          <h3>Hospital Patient Management System</h3>
          <p>
            HPMS is a console-based Hospital Patient Management System written in C++. It allows users to register, search, update, delete, and categorize patient records based on symptoms and diagnoses. The program uses a plain text file to persist data between sessions. Developed as a first-semester group project, it served as a practical introduction to file handling and structured data management in C++.
