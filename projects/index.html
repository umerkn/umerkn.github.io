          <h3>Hospital Patient Management System</h3>
          <p>
            A C++ console app for managing patient records based on symptoms. This was a group project during my first semester at university, aimed at organizing patient data efficiently for hospitals or clinics. It helps track symptoms, diagnoses, and treatment history.

          <p>
            A simple GPA calculator I created to calculate my grades and track my academic performance. This side project allows users to input their grades and compute their cumulative GPA based on different grading scales.
