    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Umer, a first-year AI undergrad who enjoys building things with C++,
      C, and HTML/CSS. I spend a lot of time in Linux, learning by doing,
      breaking things (on purpose) and figuring out how to fix them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I care about tech that's useful and accessible. I'm interested in
      bioinformatics and follow open-source projects closely. If you're working
      on something interesting, chances are I’m curious about it.
