      I'm Umer Khan, a first-year AI student who enjoys working with C++, C, and HTML/CSS. I’m a fan of Linux and free software, and I use it whenever I get the chance alongside Windows.
    </p>

    <p>
      I like learning by doing. Whether it's writing a command-line app, building a small tool, or fixing something that broke, I enjoy figuring things out and making them work.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm curious about bioinformatics, animal welfare, and using technology for good. I like cats, care about clean and readable code, and enjoy collaborating on projects with purpose.
